# Zoe vidmaster ![Agent version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zoe_Agent-0.1.0-blue.svg "Zoe vidmaster")

Automated video editing capabilities for Zoe.

This agent has a static copy of [vidmaster](https://github.com/rmed/vidmaster) and uses it as an additional library for performing the compositions.

**This agent only works on 32 and 64 bit architectures due to the `imageio` module.**

## How to use

Send a mail to Zoe with `vidmaster` as the subject and attach a **single** *.vidscript* file to use as the argument for the vidmaster workbench.
